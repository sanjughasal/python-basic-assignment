Q9. File Version Control System
Write a Python program to simulate a basic version control system for a directory of files. The script should:
Accept a directory path as input and store versions of files whenever changes are made.
Each time a file is modified, the script should create a new version and save it in a separate folder (e.g., ./versions).
Keep track of file versions by naming them with a version number or timestamp (e.g., file_v1.txt, file_v2.txt).
When a file is restored to a previous version, it should be copied from the version folder back to the original directory.
Bonus:
Implement the ability to compare file versions and show differences (similar to diff).
Add an option to automatically clean up old versions, keeping only the last n versions of each file.
